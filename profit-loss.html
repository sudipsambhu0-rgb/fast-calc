<h2>Understanding Profit and Loss</h2>
<p>Profit and loss calculation is essential in business, trading, and daily financial decisions. Profit occurs when the selling price is greater than the cost price, while loss happens when the cost price is higher than the selling price.</p>

<p>This calculator helps you instantly determine whether you made a profit or loss and also shows the percentage. It is useful for shop owners, students, online sellers, and anyone managing finances.</p>

<p>The basic formula for profit is: Profit = Selling Price − Cost Price. The profit percentage is calculated as (Profit / Cost Price) × 100. Similarly, loss is calculated when cost price is greater than selling price.</p>

<p>Understanding profit and loss helps you make better pricing decisions, manage expenses, and grow your business. It is also useful for comparing deals, discounts, and investment returns.</p>

<p>Simply enter your cost price and selling price in the calculator and click calculate. You will instantly see whether you made profit or loss along with percentage.</p>

<p>Financial awareness is an important skill in life. By regularly using this calculator, you can improve your money management skills and avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
